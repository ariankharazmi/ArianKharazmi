### Hi!ðŸ‘‹

Hello, my name is Arian Kharazmi. 
I am a student at the University of Cincinnati and I am a Sophomore student currently pursuing a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Information Technology. 

I am pursuing a career in IT because I have always wanted to use technology for the ability to push communities forward
and change someoneâ€™s life you donâ€™t even know for the better. 
I want to be involved in the decisions that can help our world progress forward. 
My dream is to someday have my own tech start-up company.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on self teaching Python and the fundamentals about microcontrollers. I want to learn more about Raspberry Pi(s) and Arduinos.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python 3, perhaps C++ after.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on more IT related projects and repositories.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with getting better with Python.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about technology
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: email.
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him
- âš¡ Fun fact: I would love to go skydiving.



--> That is pretty much it. Thanks for visiting my page!
