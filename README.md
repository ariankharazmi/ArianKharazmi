### Hi!ðŸ‘‹

Hello, my name is Arian Kharazmi. 
I am a student at the University of Cincinnati and I am a Junior student currently pursuing a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Information Technology and a Master's/MSc degree in Computer Science.

I am pursuing a career in IT/CS because I have always wanted to use technology for the ability to push communities forward
and change someoneâ€™s life you donâ€™t even know for the better. 
I want to be involved in the decisions that can help our world progress forward. 
My dream is to someday have my own tech start-up company.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on several projects and learning about Full-Stack Software Development for uni.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently self-learning Python and getting started with the Swift language!
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on IT/CS related projects and repositories.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with making better GitHub Pages.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything technology-related.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: Email.
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him
- âš¡ Fun fact: I have once flown on a flight with a U.S Supreme Court Justice.
