Hello, my name is Arian Kharazmi. 
I am a student at the University of Cincinnati and I am a Senior student currently pursuing a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Information Technology - (Software Application Development) and an MSc (or PhD) degree in Computer Science.

I am pursuing a career in tech because I have always wanted to use technology for the ability to push communities forward
and change someoneâ€™s life you donâ€™t even know for the better. 
I want to be involved in the decisions that can help our world progress forward. 
My hope is to give back in some way, shape or form.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on several projects and trying to learn as much as possible!
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently self-learning Python and diving into the world of AI and LLMs/RAGs.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on IT-CS related projects and repositories.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with becoming more knowledgeable about ML/Transformers
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything technology-related.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: Email, text, LinkedIn!
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him
- âš¡ Fun fact: I have once flown on a flight with a U.S Supreme Court Justice.
